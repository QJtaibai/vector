# Sparse Linear Algebra

## Introduction

*Sparse linear algebra is not linear algebra with lots of zeroes.*
Sparse linear algebra has its own structure and definitions, meant to directly operate on *sparse matrices*.
A sparse matrix $`\mathbf{A} = \left\langle D, M, N, \{(i,j,A_{ij})\} \right\rangle`$ is defined by
a domain $D$, its number of rows $M > 0$, its number of columns $N > 0$, and a set of tuples
$(i \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [0,M), j \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [0,N), A_{ij} \in D)$.
A particular pair of values $i,j$ can appear at most once in $\mathbf{A}$.
