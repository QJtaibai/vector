## Introduction

*Sparse linear algebra is not linear algebra with lots of zeroes.*
Sparse linear algebra has its own structure and definitions, meant to directly operate on *sparse matrices*.
A sparse matrix $`\mathbf{A} = \left\langle D, M, N, \{(i,j,A_{ij})\} \right\rangle`$ is defined by
a domain $D$, its number of rows $M > 0$, its number of columns $N > 0$, and a set of tuples
$(i \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [0,M), j \in \mathbb{Z} \cap [0,N), A_{ij} \in D)$.
A particular pair of values $i,j$ can appear at most once in $\mathbf{A}$. 
The set $`\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{A}) = \{(i,j,A_{ij}\}`$ is called the *content* of matrix $\mathbf{A}$.
(If we were dealing exclusively with sparse matrices, $\mathbf{L}(\mathbf{A})$ would uniquely define $\mathbf{A}$.
Because we will operate with both sparse and dense matrices, we need the $M$ and $N$ parameters.)

> Example: consider the matrix
> ```math
> \mathbf{A} = \left\langle \mathbb{R}, 4, 3, \left\{ (0, 0, 1.0), (0, 2, 0.5), (1, 1, 3.1), (1, 2, 0.0), (2, 0, 2.0), (2, 1, 1.0), (3,2, 5.0) \right\} \right\rangle.

> The visual representation of this matrix would be the following:
> ```math
> \mathbf{A} = 
> \left[
> \begin{array}{ccc}
> 1.0   &      & 0.5   \\
>       & 3.1  & 0.0   \\
> 2.0   & 1.0  &       \\
>       &      & 5.0
> \end{array}
> \right]

> *Important*: The "missing" values in the contents of the matrix are not "0", they simply *do not exist*.

The definition above is orthogonal to and independent of the data structures used to represent sparse matrices.
Standard sparse data structure formats, such as COO, CSR, and CSC, can all be used to represent sparse matrices as defined above.

Operations on sparse matrices, including sparse matrix/dense vector- and sparse matrix/dense matrix-multiplication (SpMV and SpMM) are defined on a *semiring*.
A semiring $`S = \left\langle D, \oplus, \otimes, \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{1} \right\rangle`$ is defined by a domain $D$, 
a binary commutative additive operation $\oplus$, a binary multiplicative operation $\otimes$, a semiring addititve identity (SAID) $\mathbf{0} \in D$ ($a \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} \oplus a = a, \forall a \in D$)
that is also the multiplicative anihalator ($ a \otimes \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0} \otimes a = \mathbf{0}, \forall a \in D$), and a semiring multiplicative identity (SMID) $\mathbf{1} \in D$ ($a \otimes \mathbf{1} = \mathbf{1} \otimes a = a, \forall a \in D$).
The multiplicative operation $\otimes$ distributes over the additive operation $\oplus$.
