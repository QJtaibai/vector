# Vector SIG Charter

SIMD functionality appears in all classes of system, from embedded
microcontrollers all the way up to data center and HPC servers.

Currently only the initial V and Zve* vector extensions have been
ratified by RISC-V, and there are only two active SIMD TGs: the vector
TG is finishing up the Zvfh extension and the Packed SIMD TG is
working on the P extension.  Several groups are discussing other
potential SIMD extensions, including the Graphics/ML SIG, while other
RISC-V SIMD proposals and research are happening throughout the world.
This SIG is intended to provide a venue for community members to
discuss and select which ideas should advance into eventual future
standard extensions.

The Vector SIG is managed under the Unpriv Committee, and is intended
to develop the strategy, gaps, and prioritizations for all SIMD
instructions within RISC-V.  We intend that this SIG will be ongoing
and spawn or help spawn new TGs as appropriate to fulfil the strategy.
An important role of the SIG is prioritizing which extensions to
pursue next and to limit the scope of new TGs to develop extensions
that can be completed in bounded time with the constrained resources
available.

In addition to SIMD ISA design, we expect this SIG to work with the
Applications and Tools committee to identify pieces of the software
ecosystem that need to be enhanced or completed to make RISC-V members
successful in using existing or future proposed SIMD extensions.
