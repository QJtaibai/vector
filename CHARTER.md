# Vector Charter

The Vector SIG is an extension of the Unpriv Committee, and is intended to develop the strategy, gaps, and prioritizations for SIMD instructions within RISC-V. Currently only the initial vector specification has been ratified by RISC-V. There are groups discussing other potential SIMD extensions including the Graphics/ML SIG, Packed SIMD TG and the Vector TG (filling in some items that need to be completed like Zvfh). While this is a fairly large landscape already, there are SIMD proposals and research happening throughout the world on RISC-V. If community members want to advance those ideas, This SIG is intended to be the venue for those discussions.

We have seen SIMD functionality show up in embedded all the way up to their more traditional venues in data center and HPC servers. This SIG will cover the scope for all of these targets but may decide to prioritize some over others in RISC-V's ongoing effort to do less things better and avoid trying to do too much and accomplishing nothing.

In addition to SIMD instructions, we expect this SIG to work with the Applications and Tools committee to identify pieces of the Software ecosystem that need to be enhanced or completed to make RISC-V members successful in using SIMD extensions.

We intend that this SIG will be ongoing and spawn or help spawn other SIGs or TGs as appropriate to fullfill the strategy.

We intend to articulate and write the strategy, identify gaps and priorties in stages during calendar year 2022.
