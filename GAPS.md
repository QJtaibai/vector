# Vector SIG Gap Analysis

This is a living document maintained by the RISC-V Vector SIG in fulfillment of our [charter](https://github.com/riscv-admin/vector/blob/main/CHARTER.md). 
It reflects our assessment of the current capabilities of RISC-V SIMD processing and our vision for enhancing those capabilities. 
The topics in this gap analysis are discussed in the Vector SIG technical meetings, as listed in the [RISC-V Technical Meetings Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=tech.meetings@riscv.org). 
A topic is moved to this document when there is consensus that it should be pursued and enough clarity on what to pursue. 
For each topic, we will propose a Task Group to pursue the work in developing the specification of the necessary enhancements.
An initial Task Group will be formed to perform the preliminary work and prepare a true *Task Group proposal* that can be brought in front of the Technical Steering Committee for approval.
